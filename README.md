ListPlay
========

Spotify playlist curation app

Installing
----------

* Download the zip, expand, rename bundle to xlistplay
* Move to ~/Spotify
* Open Spotify, type 'spotify:app:xlistplay' in the search bar
* Save as a favourite (the 'x' in front of 'listplay' makes it display at the bottom of the apps list. You can change this - just make sure the bundle name and the 'BundleIdentifier' string in the manifest file both match.)

Using
-----

* Drag n drop a playlist onto each container
* Drag tracks within a playlist, or from one playlist to another
* Drag multiple tracks by cmd-selecting them
* The Delete key removes the selected tracks
* Dragging tracks with the Shift key down will copy the tracks rather than move them
* Double-click to play a track etc


Features that would be good to implement
